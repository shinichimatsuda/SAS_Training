* Modify the DATA step to select only the observations 
with Emp_Hire_Date values on or after July 1, 2010.
Subset the observations as they are being read into the PDV.;

 that have an Increase value greater than 3000. ;

Employee_ID, Emp_Hire_Date, Salary, Increase, and NewSalary. ;

* Add permanent labels for Employee_ID, Emp_Hire_Date, and NewSalary.
 Add a PROC CONTENTS step and submit the program to verify
 that the labels are stored in the descriptor portion of the new data set work.increase. ;

* Add permanent formats to display Salary and NewSalary with dollar signs,
 commas, and two decimal places, and Increase with commas and no decimal places.
 Add a PROC CONTENTS step and submit the program to verify that the formats are stored
 in the descriptor portion of the new data set work.increase. ;

* Some variables have labels and formats that were not defined in this program.
 How were these created? ;

/* Response: The existing labels and formats were inherited from the input data set, orion.staff. */

* Write a PROC PRINT step to create this report, with labels split over multiple lines.
 The results should contain 10 observations. ;
