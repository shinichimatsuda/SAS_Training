proc print data=orion.order_fact;
	where total_retail_price >= 500;
	sum total_retail_price;

Verify that there are 35 observations in the results.
How can you verify the number of observations in the results?;
proc print data=orion.order_fact noobs;
	where total_retail_price >= 500;
	sum total_retail_price;
run;

* Add an ID statement to use Customer_ID as the identifying variable. Submit the program.
The results contain 35 observations. How did the output change?;
proc print data=orion.order_fact noobs;
	where total_retail_price >= 500;
	id customer_id;
	sum total_retail_price;
run;

* Add a VAR statement to display Customer_ID, Order_ID, Order_Type, Quantity,

What do you notice about Customer_ID?;
proc print data=orion.order_fact noobs;
	where total_retail_price >= 500;
	id customer_id;
	var customer_id order_id order_type quantity total_retail_price;
	sum total_retail_price;
run;

* Remove the duplicate column by removing Customer_ID from the VAR statement.;
proc print data=orion.order_fact noobs;
	where total_retail_price >= 500;
	id customer_id;
	var order_id order_type quantity total_retail_price;
