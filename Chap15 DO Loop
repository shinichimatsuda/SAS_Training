***** Do loop;

data certprep.earnings;
	set certprep.master;
	Earned = 0;
	do month = 1 to 12; /* DO index-variable = start TO stop BY increment */
		earned + (amount + earned) * (rate/12);
	end;
run;

data certprep.earnings;
	Amount = 1000;
	Rate = .075/12;
	Earned = 0;
	do month = 1 to 12;
		Earned + (amount + Earned) * rate;
	end;
run;

*** Counting Iterations of DO Loops;

data certprep.earn (drop = counter); /* counter is an index variable which is to be dropped*/
	Value = 2000;
	do counter = 1 to 20;
		Interest = value * .075;
		value + interest;
		 Year + 1;
		 /* Year+1 accumulates the number of iterations of the DO loop and
		    stores the total in the new variable Year. */
	end;
run;

*** Using Explicit OUTPUT Statements;

data certprep.earn2;
	Value = 2000;
	do Year = 1 to 20;
		Interest = value * .075;
		value + interest;
		output;
	end;
run;
